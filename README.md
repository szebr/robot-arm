# robot arm

![](robot.gif)

I made this robot arm in an Introduction to Computer Graphics class at the University of Pittsburgh. It was written in C with OpenGL.

It uses a custom matrix and vertex implementation and demonstrates understanding of matrix composition to rotate and scale graphics on screen.

## Usage
```
cd lab
./project4
```

...or you can use the makefile in that same folder. simple stuff.
